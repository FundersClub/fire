Greetings, [Firebot](https://firebot.fundersclub.com/) here!

@{{ repo.inviter_login }} recently invited me to join this fine repository. Before Firebot is enabled, however, @{{ repo.inviter_login }} has one more step to do...

**[Complete Firebot setup now]({{ settings.BASE_URL }}/approve/{{ repo.uuid }}/)**

Only @{{ repo.inviter_login }} will be able to enable Firebot using the above link. If Firebot was added in error or you would no longer like to use Firebot, feel free to remove the `fire-bot` collaborator from your repository and you won't be bothered again!
