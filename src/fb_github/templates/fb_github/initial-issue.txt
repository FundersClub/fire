Greetings, @fire-bot from [FundersClub Catalyst](https://fire.fundersclub.com/) here!

@{{ repo.inviter_login }} recently invited me (@fire-bot) to join this repository and help your team easily create issues over email. @{{ repo.inviter_login }} still needs to complete a few steps before I'm fully operational:

**[Complete fire setup now]({{ settings.BASE_URL }}/approve/{{ repo.uuid }}/)**

(Only @{{ repo.inviter_login }} will be able to enable me using the above link. If someone added me to your repo by mistake or you would no longer like to use my services, feel free to remove @fire-bot from your repo's collaborators and I won't bother you again!)

**Once I am installed, here is what you can do:**
- The subject of your email will become the title of the issue
- The email body to becomes to issue contents: describe bugs, feature request, or anything else.
- Include attachments (images, videos, or anything)
- Forward emails from Intercom, bug reports from Sentry, or any other service to me, and I'll file an issue for it
