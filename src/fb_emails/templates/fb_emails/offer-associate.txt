Hello {{ msg.from_name }},

This looks like the first time you have e-mailed {{ msg.to_email }}. I don't recognize your e-mail address, but I will still create the issue for you.
However, because I don't recognize you I can't tag you in the issue. This prevents you from receiving notifications when something changes on the GitHub issue.
If you have a GitHub account, you can go to the URL so that I can properly tag you in issues you open:
{{ settings.BASE_URL }}{% url 'fb_github:associate-email' repo.login repo.name msg.uuid %}

If you are not interested in this, simply ignore this email. I will not contact you again about this repository.

Thank you,
The FireBot.
