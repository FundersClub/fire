Hey there,

fire just received an email from {{ msg.from_email }} to your fire email address ({{ repo.email }}). We tried to create an Issue in your Repository, but it seems that we no longer have access.

If you intentionally removed fire, you can ignore this message. Otherwise, please re-add the "fire-bot" user to your Repo (as a Read Only contributor) to continue using fire.

Thanks!
