## Contributing to fire

Glad to see you're interested in getting involved. Before you dive in, please [surface your feature request/bug in an Issue](https://github.com/FundersClub/fire/issues). This will give the repository owners the opportunity to provide any feedback or considerations that may be non-obvious (e.g. where in the code it should live, whether the issue has already been prioritized, edge cases which may be difficult, etc). From there, please follow the standard process of forking/making commits/creating pull requests.

Please don't hesitate to [reach out via Issue](https://github.com/FundersClub/fire/issues) with any questions of feedback!

Thanks,
The FundersClub Team
